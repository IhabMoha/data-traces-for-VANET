# datasets-for-VANET
There are a number of datasets with traces for VANET, some datasets are generated based on simulations of real cities while others are generated based on specific parameters.

The datastes are:

### - 32: this dataset is generated from a simulation using SUMO with a maximum of 32 neighboring cars.
### - 64: this dataset is generated from a simulation using SUMO with a maximum of 64 neighboring cars.
### - 128: this dataset is generated from a simulation using SUMO with a maximum of 128 neighboring cars.
### - Bologna: this dataset is generated from a simulation of the Bologna city in Italy.
### - Erlangen: this dataset is generated from a simulation of the Erlangen city in Germany.
